				<h2 id="history">Oral History of Barangays</h2>
				<p>Oral tradition has long been an important part of human culture, serving as a means of passing down knowledge, traditions, and values from generation to generation. In the Philippines, a country rich in diverse cultural heritage, oral history has played a critical role in preserving local community narratives. The purpose of this term paper is to delve into the fascinating journey of tracing the oral history of the barangays in Boac, Marinduque, Philippines, and to shed light on the significance of preserving these narratives for future generations. Boac, Marinduque's capital municipality, is known for its vibrant history and cultural significance. Boac's barangays, or local administrative divisions, are distinguished by distinctive stories, legends, and customs that reflect the collective memory and identity of its people. However, with the passage of time and the influence of modernization, these oral traditions face extinction.</p>

				<p>Legend of Isok 1: Once upon a time there was a remote place where people were not aware of the arrival of the Spaniards. So they don't know what church, school and so on is. Even the name of the place where they live. One day they were in the backyard. Two elderly men who were blind and hard of hearing in their fire passed a stranger who was also hearing poor. He asked the two elders the name of the place you were staying but because of the poor hearing he thought he was asking for the smoke call. And the two elders said "smoke" but because of hearing weakness he heard the answer. When the other Spaniard arrived, the first one told him what had happened and told his companion what they had learned about the Isok.</p>

				<p>Laylay: Legend of Capala: Once upon a time, the people who lived here loved to fight. The weapons they use are sharp knives, brains and arrows. There was a man who was a brave warrior. His courage was known to all who lived there, and they were all afraid of him. He often went to places with his sharp brain. Many of the men in their area were angry with him, but no one tried to challenge him in a fight. One night this brave man went to a place and the men there waited, and as he returned to a dark place he was suddenly struck by a brain in his arm. The man was very strong and almost had a strong hand in his hand. Even though the blood flowed strongly to his wound, he managed to get home, a resident saw him when he got home and shouted "shoulder-strapped." A few hours later, the man died of injuries. Since then, the inhabitants have called their place "LAYLAY" derived from the word "shoulder-laid."</p>

				<p>Legend of Santol: In ancient times, the American and Spanish army was in the province of Marinduque. In this area many Santol trees were planted and at that time there were fruit buds. One day the Spaniards were watching the town, a Filipino came to meet them selling salt and the Spaniard asked him "We have fruit yellow and green in color and round shape. What is that fruit called?" The Filipino replied and said, "That fruit is Santol, taste the yellow fruit and that's sweet and the Filipino went and left the Spanish surprised. As he tasted the yellow fruit he looked up at the sun and likened it to a round and yellow like the sun in the sky which in English is called sun and the fruit tree is tall in English so the Spanish spoke and they called it Santol. So, every time they go through the area, they are happy to tell stories because there are so many trees in the SANTOL. The population of the area is growing, so they call it the "Santa Claus."</p>

				<p>Legend of the Land: Long before the Spaniards arrived on the coasts of the small islands of Marinduque there were foreigners who came before them led by the men of Captain Lu, a pirate of Limahong. This group landed on the coast of this village. They are friendly with the indigenous peoples who are mostly fishermen who legitimately live in this area. One day during Captain Lu's visit, he noticed many Palmer trees called "BUNGA" by the natives. This so-called Palmerang has a wide stem of a lump or a lump. This tree has a wide tree that can be used as a dining room, a blanket, a scarf, or slippers and its white skin can be used as paper for children to write on in school. Whenever Captain Lu walks in the heat or in the middle of the rain, he asks the natives to feed the natives with a "fruit" or palm tree. Since then, because of the many uses of this plant, which has many inhabitants quietly and securely, they have called it "TALUPAK" from the wide and useful stems of the Fruit tree or Palmera. As time went on, the word "land" became shorter and became "LUPAC."</p>

				<p>Murallon Legend: According to the story of the elders, in ancient times, even before the Spaniards came to Marinduque, the inhabitants of the seaside now known as Laylay, fled about three kilometers away from their hilly and rocky area that they thought were safe from other evil people. When the Spaniards arrived, they built roads between the said hills, they arranged them so that people and chariots could pass through them. The road extends to the foot of the mountain where the church is located. It was named "Real" road. The hill that separates from Santol to the town was called Murallon by the Spaniards. Since then, the city has been called Mr. Sitio Murallon. When the Americans arrived, they expanded the roads. Real was renamed the road Nepomuceno in honor of Kgg. Ricardo Nepomuceno who became the Kalihin of Public Works and Communication. The Sitio ng Murallon is now recognized as Barangay Murallon which admires the Ramon Magsaysay Road to the town centre.</p>
