				<h1>Torrijos, Marinduque</h1>
				<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
				<p>The municipality has a land area of 178.92 square kilometers or 69.08 square miles which constitutes 18.78% of Marinduque's total area. Its population as determined by the 2020 Census was 30,476. This represented 12.74% of the total population of Marinduque province, or 0.94% of the overall population of the MIMAROPA Region. Based on these figures, the population density is computed at 170 inhabitants per square kilometer or 441 inhabitants per square mile.</p>


				<h2 id="history">History of Torrijos</h2>
				<p>The municipality of Torrijos was established on May 25, 1880 through Real Order No. 469. On May 29, 1884, Royal Decree No. 304 was issued, approving its ecclesiastical foundation into parish from its mother town Santa Cruz.</p>

				<p>On September 13, 1900, during the Philippine–American War an engagement in Torrijos pitted the forces of Philippine Revolutionary Army Colonel Maximo Abad against the Americans led by Captain Devereux Shields. Abad's men defeated the American force, it was one of the worst defeats suffered by the Americans during the war. This was known as the Battle of Pulang Lupa which took place in Torrijos. A monument now stands on the mountain where the battle took place, known as Pulang Lupa or "Red Mountain" due to the red soil. In 1942, the Japanese occupied the town of Torrijos, Marinduque.</p>

				<p>In 1945, in the Battle of Marinduque, American and Filipino troops fought in and around the town of Torrijos and Marinduque against the Japanese soldiers during World War II.</p>

				<h2 id="battle">Battle of Pulang Lupa</h2>
				<p>On September 11, Captain Devereux Shields led a detachment of 54 29th U.S. Volunteer Infantrymen into the mountains of Torrijos to combat the elusive Abad and his guerrillas. 278  They experienced little success, except for the dispersing of 20 guerrillas, in which no casualties were inflicted on either side.</p>

				<p>Abad had excellent intelligence and was informed of Shields' movements by the local guerrillas ahead of time. In response, he assembled his entire force of around 180–250 regular Filipino soldiers and 1,000–2,000 bolomen, although some sources claim as few as 300 altogether. The regular Philippine soldiers were well organized and reasonably well armed with bolos, pistols, and Spanish Mausers, despite the fact that most were poor shots. The bolomen, armed only with machetes or bolos, served mainly to bolster Abad's forces. Dressed as friendly farmers or civilians in the daytime, they took part in guerrilla activities at night: ambushing small detachments of American soldiers, sabotage, and most importantly, supplying Abad with intelligence on American positions and movements. They had little military value however, considering they had no firearms.</p>

				<p>On September 13, Abad positioned his men along a steep ridge overlooking the trail which Shields would soon cross. Both Shields and his men had little combat experience and easily fell into the trap. Abad and his 250 soldiers opened fire on the column, which led to a fire-fight that lasted for several hours. Meanwhile, as the Americans and Philippine riflemen exchanged fire, the large force of Filipino bolomen began maneuvering to surround the Americans.</p>

				<p>Shields, seeing that he was almost completely surrounded, ordered a withdrawal, which soon turned into a full-blown retreat, as Abad's much larger force poured over the ridge after Shields and his men. The Filipino soldiers harassed Shields for nearly 4 miles (6 km) before cornering them in a small rice field; their escape to Santa Cruz was cut off by the large force of Filipino bolomen. Abad's men again opened fire, forcing the Americans to take cover behind some paddy dikes. Shields, wounded and recognizing the futility of the situation, raised the white flag in order to surrender.</p>

				<p>After months of hiding, Abad in only a few hours eliminated nearly one third of the American garrison on Marinduque</p>

				<p>Shields' defeat sent shock waves through the American high command. Aside from being one of the worst defeats suffered by the Americans during the war, it was especially significant given its proximity to the upcoming election between President William McKinley and his anti-imperialist opponent William Jennings Bryan, the outcome of which many believed would determine the ultimate course of the war. Consequently, the defeat triggered a sharp response.</p>

				<p>Arthur MacArthur, Jr. sent Brig. Gen. Luther Hare with "orders to treat the entire male population over fifteen as potential enemies and to arrest as many as possible and hold them hostages until Abad surrendered.  Hare secured the release of Shields and his men. Maj. Frederick A. Smith continued the policy of destroying food and shelter in the interior of the island, and moving all civilians into the towns. Although Abad and most of his command continued to elude the American military, the civilian population was suffering for it, with many landowners and merchants joining the Federal Party, turning against Abad. These new tactics led to the surrender of Abad in April 1901.</p>
