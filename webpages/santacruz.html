				<h1>Santa Cruz, Marinduque</h1>
				<h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
				<p>The municipality has a land area of 270.77 square kilometers or 104.54 square miles which constitutes 28.42% of Marinduque's total area. Its population as determined by the 2020 Census was 54,692. This represented 22.86% of the total population of Marinduque province, or 1.69% of the overall population of the MIMAROPA Region. Based on these figures, the population density is computed at 202 inhabitants per square kilometer or 523 inhabitants per square mile.</p>


				<h2 id="politics">History of Politics</h2>
				<p>Pre-Colonial Era: Before the arrival of the Spanish colonizers in the Philippines, Marinduque was already inhabited by several ethnic groups, including the Tagalogs, Visayans, and Mangyans. These groups had their own unique socio-political systems, based on kinship ties, communal land ownership, and the worship of ancestral spirits.</p>

				<p>Spanish Colonial Period: In 1570, the Spanish conquistador Miguel Lopez de Legazpi arrived in the Philippines and began a campaign of colonization and conversion to Christianity. Marinduque was eventually incorporated into the Spanish colonial empire, with the first Catholic mission established in Sta. Cruz in 1580. Under Spanish rule, Sta. Cruz became part of the province of Mindoro, and later, the province of Tayabas (now Quezon). The town was governed by a gobernadorcillo, who acted as both mayor and judge. The gobernadorcillo was appointed by the Spanish authorities and was responsible for enforcing laws, collecting taxes, and maintaining order in the community.Sta. Cruz played an important role in the Philippine Revolution of 1896, which aimed to overthrow Spanish colonial rule. In 1898, the town was liberated by Filipino revolutionaries under the leadership of General Emilio Aguinaldo.</p>

				<p>American Colonial Period: After the defeat of Spain in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines came under American colonial rule. Sta. Cruz became part of the province of Marinduque, which was created in 1901. The Americans introduced a new system of governance in the Philippines, based on the principles of democracy and local autonomy. The town was now governed by an elected municipal president, who was responsible for the administration of local affairs. Sta. Cruz experienced rapid development during the American period, with the construction of roads, bridges, schools, and other public works. The town also became a center of commerce and trade, with the establishment of markets and businesses.</p>

				<p>Japanese Occupation: During World War II, the Philippines was occupied by Japanese forces, who established a brutal regime that resulted in the deaths of thousands of Filipinos. Sta. Cruz was not spared from the atrocities committed by the Japanese, with many residents subjected to forced labor, torture, and execution. Resistance movements, such as the Hukbalahap and the Philippine Commonwealth Army, operated in Marinduque during the Japanese occupation. These groups engaged in guerilla warfare against the Japanese, sabotaging their operations and providing support to the Allied forces</p>

				<p>Post-Independence: In 1946, the Philippines gained independence from the United States, ushering in a new era of self-rule. Sta. Cruz continued to be governed by elected officials, with the municipal president serving as the chief executive. The post-war period saw the rise of political dynasties in Sta. Cruz, with certain families dominating the local political scene. These dynasties often relied on patronage, bribery, and intimidation to maintain their hold on power.</p>

				<p>Martial Law Era: In 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law, suspending civil liberties and cracking down on political opposition. Sta. Cruz was not immune to the effects of martial law, with many residents subjected to human rights abuses and repression. Despite the dangers, some individuals in Sta. Cruz continued to resist the Marcos regime. Activists and community leaders organized protests, strikes, and other forms of resistance, calling for an end to dictatorship and the restoration of democracy.</p>

				<p>Post-Martial Law: In 1986, a peaceful revolution known as the People Power Movement ended the Marcos dictatorship and restored democracy to the Philippines. Sta. Cruz played its part in this historic event, with residents joining protests and rallies against the dictatorship. Since the fall of Marcos, Sta. Cruz has witnessed both progress and setbacks in terms of governance. Some officials have worked hard to promote transparency, accountability, and good governance, while others have been accused of corruption and abuse of power.</p>
