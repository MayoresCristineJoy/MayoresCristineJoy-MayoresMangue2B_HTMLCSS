				<h2 id="history">Historical Background and Local Heroes</h2>
				<p>According to a blog, Marinduque is an isolated volcanic mass surrounded by coral reefs, Marinduque lies between Tayabas Bay to the north and Sibuyan Sea to the south. It is west of Quezon Province’s Bondoc Peninsula; east of Mindoro Island  and north of the island province of Romblon. This small heart-shaped island is famous for its colorful Moriones Festival, the unique and imaginative reenactment of a Roman centurion’s conversion to Christianity and his subsequent beheading. For over 200 years, the province is home to one of the oldest religious festivals of the country featuring masked men colorfully dressed in the likeness of roman soldiers. It is celebrated annually every Holy Week. Marinduque’s original settlers were Mangyan and Malay people. Evidence from Sung dynasty pottery dates contact with Chinese traders to between 920 and 1289. Also, according to the blog, “The Marinduque Museum has interesting displays, including some pieces found in the ancient Chinese junk (over 500 years old) that is submerged in the waters off of the Tres Reyes (Three Kings) Islands, southwest of Gasan. The largest of the three, and closest to Marinduque’s southwest coast, is Gaspar Island, with Melchor Island and Baltazar Island beyond. These islands are named after the biblical Three Kings: Gaspar, Melchor, and Baltazar. The wreck of a 15th– century Chinese trading vessel occurred between Pingan and Gaspar. A large number of ceramic pieces have been recovered, including Shantou porcelain and stoneware jars, and some iron skillets.” </p>

				<p>There are also some oral history story that is known in the discovery of Marinduque. They said that a powerful southern Luzon King named Datu Batumbacal (literally, “ironstone”) prevented his daughter, Princess Marin from accepting the love of a fisherman-poet, Garduke and ordered the poet slain. The lovers sailed out to sea and drowned themselves. Marinduqe Island grew from the spot where the couple committed suicide. Boac, the provincial capital and seat of business and commerce, is situated on the west coast. The original settlement was call biak (split) because it occupied both sides of the Boac River. It is a sleepy settlement, dominated by a large church building. The fortresslike church at Boac was built in 1792 as a shrine for the miraculous Lady of Biglang Awa (Sudden Mercy) to which is attributed deliverance from a Moro attack. The church has massive walls that are one and half to two meters thick, beautiful restored façade and sits high on a hill. There are good views from the bell tower. It features Filipino-Hispanic Gothic architecture, with much of the original structure faithfully preserved – the façade and main body, the belfry, and the altar. On the northern coast, the town of Santa Cruz has a Spanish church built in 1714. Also, in the town of Santa Cruz is the mysterious Bathala Caves complex, formed of coral limestone that’s been upthrust about 30 meters above sea level.  Only four of the seven caves have so far been explored. The first is called the Simbahan (church), owing to its cathedral-like interior where stalagmites form a rough likeness to an altar, a bell and a silhouette of the Virgin Mary carrying the Child. The second cave is darker and deeper, and reputedly guarded by a python. The third has an underground river, and the fourth cave harbors human bones, thought to be the remains of World War II soldiers.</p>

				<p>During the Spanish and early American occupations, Marinduque was part of Balayan Province (now Batangas) in the 16th century, Mindoro in the 17th century, and had a brief period as an independent province in 1901, when the Americans arrived.</p>

				<p>Throughout history, Marinduque has produced remarkable individuals who have made an impact on a national and even international scale. Their stories are as diverse as the province itself, spanning from pioneering leaders who have fought for autonomy to intellectuals who have shaped education and arts in Marinduque. Join us as we uncover the backgrounds of these extraordinary individuals, delving into their upbringing, influences, and the experiences that molded them into the local heroes and personalities they are today. Through their stories, we gain a deeper understanding of Marinduque's rich heritage and the spirit of its people.</p>

				<p>1.) Martin Lardizabal is a former governor in Marinduque who served from 1899-1901. According to an oral history, when the Philippine-American war started Lardizabal was still the governor but due to a lingering illness he appointed Col. Maximo Abad, Chief of the Marinduque Revolutionary Force to replace him. Also, Cemeterio de Tampus was the final resting place of Martin Lardizabal which is the Marinduque’s first military governor during the first phase of the Philippine revolution in this island-province. Lardizabal’s burial place has remained undocumented. In 2008, the Philippine Senate adopted a resolution and is in a move to honor the courage and self-sacrifice of Filipino heroes whose deeds remain lost in history books and in memories of the people and it is the Resolution No. 54 that establishment of a separate grave site or a memorial in Libingan ng mga Bayani to honor the heroism of all Filipino soldiers during the Philippine-American War. In this resolution, lesser known names were cited and included. Martin Lardizabal name was included in this resolution and Ciriaco Vida known as “Alapaap” in those days.</p>

				<p>2.) Col. Maximo Abad is the Mariduque’s foremost hero of ‘Battle of Pulang Lupa’ in 1900. He fought during the Philippine-American War and led the Marinduque revolutionary forces that defeated the Americans in the “Battle of Pulang Lupa”. He served as the first clerk of the Court of First Instance of Marinduque and Presidente Municipal of Imus, Cavite.</p>
